Assess your javascript knowledge with sparrow-swiftness!

## Demo

A demonstration application is available [here](https://js.utocopia.com/). *Please be patient - the Heroku backend needs some time to wake up on first visit.*

## Running it yourself

Instructions to run your own Java-Sparrow instance can be found in the [server](https://github.com/deSagaz/java-sparrow/tree/master/javasparrow-server) and [client](https://github.com/deSagaz/java-sparrow/tree/master/javasparrow-client) subdirectories.

You can also use the [server-prod branch](https://github.com/deSagaz/java-sparrow/tree/prod-server) if you wish to use Amazon S3 for file storage.
