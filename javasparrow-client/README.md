# Java Sparrow Client

## Getting Started

This project was developed in Typescript. You will first need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), which will include the package manager `npm`. If you run `npm install` in the `javasparrow-client` folder, you will install the Ionic CLI and all other dependencies of the project. Pretty neat, right?

If you have never used the Angular framework before (Ionic is build around it), kudos to Maximilian for developing [this excellent course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/). Using an IDE rather than a plain text editor will make your life easier (despite the excellent error handling of Angular). [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) worked wonders.

### Development server

Once installed, run `ionic serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8100/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. You're now ready to make changes and see them reflected live in your browser.
